# Enigma
A simulation to the WWII Enigma encryption machine. 
The simulation is built for both Enigma 3 and Enigma 4 with multiple modes.
The most advanced mode is the character tracker in both 3 and 4 editions; 
it displays how characters flow within the machine.
The project is supplemented with an executable jar file that could be run directly.
